                    <p>The Scottish Records Association (SRA) offers palaeography classes to help researchers read and understand handwritten records produced in Scotland in the early modern period. Some are restricted to members of the Association only and others are open to everyone. The workshops are free of charge and are run on a voluntary basis by members of the SRA who have relevant experience in reading early-modern records and/or teaching palaeography. The classes were originally designed to be offered on-site for small groups but they have been modified to be presented online as well.</p>

                    <h2>Workshops 2024</h2>
                    <p>The SRA has created a new workshop on household papers and correspondence in private collections, in conjunction with Glamis Castle Archives, and hopes to be able to offer it (along with the workshop for palaeography beginners) in Aberdeen around 22-24 October 2024. This will coincide with the SRA conference on estate papers at the Sir Duncan Rice Library, University of Aberdeen. Further details will follow. If you would like to host a palaeography workshop, please get in touch with the Membership Secretary via the <a href="/contact/">Contact page</a>.</p>
