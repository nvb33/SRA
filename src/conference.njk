            <p>The Scottish Records Association's Annual Conference will be held in the Muniments Room at Cherry Park, the eighteenth-century estates offices at Inveraray Castle, on Friday 19 September. The conference will take a slightly different shape and form this year, with formal conference papers in the morning followed by lunch and a guided tour of Inveraray Jail in the afternoon. The focus of the day is prison records and their use in historical research, reflecting current research using prison records, the type and format of the records themselves, and the development, management and custody of these collections.</p>

            <p>The Scottish Records Association (SRA) was founded in 1977 (Scottish Charity number SC008896) and is concerned with the preservation and use of
historical records in Scotland. It provides a forum for users, owners and custodians of records to discuss matters relating to the records, their custody and conservation and research.</p>

            <p>The spring 2023 conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on Friday 24 February and was held in conjunction with National Records of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The venue was New Register House in Edinburgh. At the morning session a series of talks discussed advances in online palaeography tuition and how Artificial Intelligence can help transcribe manuscripts.</p>
            <p>During the afternoon there was an open event where researchers could bring documents they were having problems reading or understanding, to get advice from experienced palaeographers from academic institutions and archives. Also present were societies who publish original sources of Scottish history, showing how their publications can help researchers understand similar records, and how to access other useful sources. There was also a small display of original records from the National Records of Scotland's archives related to the societies' publications.</p>
            <p>The conference marked the launch of the new edition of 'Scottish Handwriting 1500-1700: a self-help pack', published jointly by the Scottish Records Association and National Records of Scotland.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Annual Conference 2022</h2>
            <h3 class="text-center"><i>Spoken Record:</i> communities and their sound archives</h3>
            <p>The 2022 annual conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on 18 May 2022 online and at the Soutar Theatre, AK Bell Library, Perth. It explored how personal testimony and sound archives are used by research projects to record the experiences of people who are connected by similarities in their working lives, geographical location, or other 'communities of interest'. Recordings from such projects have special significance for these communities, but also extend beyond them and can be re-used in different ways. Presentations were made by historians and others who use recordings in their research, and by archivists, curators and other staff who make sound archives available to researchers.</p>
