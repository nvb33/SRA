            <h3 class="text-center"><i>On the Write Track:</i> making sense of older handwriting</h3>
            <p>The spring 2023 conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on Friday 24 February and was held in conjunction with National Records of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The venue was New Register House in Edinburgh. At the morning session a series of talks discussed advances in online palaeography tuition and how Artificial Intelligence can help transcribe manuscripts.</p>
            <p>During the afternoon there was an open event where researchers could bring documents they were having problems reading or understanding, to get advice from experienced palaeographers from academic institutions and archives. Also present were societies who publish original sources of Scottish history, showing how their publications can help researchers understand similar records, and how to access other useful sources. There was also a small display of original records from the National Records of Scotland's archives related to the societies' publications.</p>
            <p>The conference marked the launch of the new edition of 'Scottish Handwriting 1500-1700: a self-help pack', published jointly by the Scottish Records Association and National Records of Scotland.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Annual Conference 2022</h2>
            <h3 class="text-center"><i>Spoken Record:</i> communities and their sound archives</h3>
            <p>The 2022 annual conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on 18 May 2022 online and at the Soutar Theatre, AK Bell Library, Perth. It explored how personal testimony and sound archives are used by research projects to record the experiences of people who are connected by similarities in their working lives, geographical location, or other 'communities of interest'. Recordings from such projects have special significance for these communities, but also extend beyond them and can be re-used in different ways. Presentations were made by historians and others who use recordings in their research, and by archivists, curators and other staff who make sound archives available to researchers.</p>
