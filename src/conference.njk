            <p>The Scottish Records Association's autumn 2025 conference will take place on <strong>Friday 19 September 2025</strong> in Cherry Park, the eighteenth-century estate offices at Inveraray Castle, and will address the subject of prison records and their use by historians and other researchers.</p>
            <p>The conference will take a slightly different shape and form this year, with traditional conference papers in the morning followed by lunch and a guided tour of Inveraray Jail.</p>
            <p>The focus of the day is prison records and their use in historical research, and we invite proposals for papers reflecting current research using prison records in public and private ownership, the type and format of the records themselves, and the development, management and custody of these collections.</p>
            <p>Themes and topics, might include, but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>prison records and how they have or may be used for historical research</li>
                    <li>reviews of projects that have used or are using prison records in new ways</li>
                    <li>issues involved in preserving, managing and providing access to prison records,</li>
                    <li>prisoners and prison employees.</li>
                </ul>
                Please note that presenters must be able to attend the conference in person.
            </p>
            <p>Enquiries about the conference, informal offers of papers and abstracts for papers (c.200 words) should be submitted to Alison Diamond at: <a href="mailto:SRAtreasurer2024@gmail.com">SRAtreasurer2024@gmail.com</a>. <strong>The closing date for submission of abstracts is mid-day on 15 May 2025</strong>.</p>
            <p>Speakers at the conference may submit written versions of their presentations for inclusion in a subsequent issue of the Associationâ€™s journal (Scottish Archives). As this issue is likely to include content on the theme of prison records, articles on related topics are also sought from anyone who cannot make a presentation at the conference. For further information on the journal please see <a href="https://www.scottishrecordsassociation.org/scottish-archives">https://www.scottishrecordsassociation.org/scottish-archives</a>.</p>
            <p>For those wishing to immerse themselves fully in the local history and culture, the conference precedes Argyll and Bute's Open Doors weekend (20 and 21 September 2025).</p>

            <h3 class="text-center"><i>On the Write Track:</i> making sense of older handwriting</h3>
            <p>The spring 2023 conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on Friday 24 February and was held in conjunction with National Records of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The venue was New Register House in Edinburgh. At the morning session a series of talks discussed advances in online palaeography tuition and how Artificial Intelligence can help transcribe manuscripts.</p>
            <p>During the afternoon there was an open event where researchers could bring documents they were having problems reading or understanding, to get advice from experienced palaeographers from academic institutions and archives. Also present were societies who publish original sources of Scottish history, showing how their publications can help researchers understand similar records, and how to access other useful sources. There was also a small display of original records from the National Records of Scotland's archives related to the societies' publications.</p>
            <p>The conference marked the launch of the new edition of 'Scottish Handwriting 1500-1700: a self-help pack', published jointly by the Scottish Records Association and National Records of Scotland.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Annual Conference 2022</h2>
            <h3 class="text-center"><i>Spoken Record:</i> communities and their sound archives</h3>
            <p>The 2022 annual conference of the Scottish Records Association took place on 18 May 2022 online and at the Soutar Theatre, AK Bell Library, Perth. It explored how personal testimony and sound archives are used by research projects to record the experiences of people who are connected by similarities in their working lives, geographical location, or other 'communities of interest'. Recordings from such projects have special significance for these communities, but also extend beyond them and can be re-used in different ways. Presentations were made by historians and others who use recordings in their research, and by archivists, curators and other staff who make sound archives available to researchers.</p>
