            <p>The Scottish Records Association (SRA) holds an <a href="/conference/">annual conference</a> and organises visits of archival interest (<a href="">summer visits</a>). A bi-annual newsletter, <a href="">Retour</a>, reports news from Scottish archives, including relevant publications and exhibitions.</p>

            <p>The annual journal, <a href="/scottish-archives/">Scottish Archives</a>, reflects both the distinctive interests of the Association's members and appeals to a wider audience. It features illustrated papers from conferences as well as other commissioned and submitted articles focussing on Scottish archives and historical sources, their use and interpretation.</p>
            <p>In conjunction with National Records of Scotland, the SRA publishes a guide to palaeography, 'Scottish Handwriting 1500-1700: a self-help pack'.</p>
